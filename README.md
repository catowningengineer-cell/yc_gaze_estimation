# yc_gaze_estimation
A hybrid CNN+Transformer model for gaze estimation using PyTorch. It predicts gaze direction from eye images, leveraging CNNs for local feature extraction and Transformers for global context. Trained on MPIIGaze and MPIIFaceGaze with custom preprocessing, angular loss, and flexible training scripts.
